# Resolve a merge conflict

1. Create the issue `[Task] Resolve a merge conflict`.
2. Complete a short learning resource on conflicts:
    - [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) (focus on merge/rebase and conflicts).
3. Coordinate with your collaborator:
    - Both of you create PRs that edit the **same lines** in the same file (e.g., the same paragraph in `README.md`).
    - Merge one PR first.
4. In the second PR, resolve the conflict (locally or on `GitHub`) and push the fix.
5. In the PR description, add a short `Conflict resolution note`:
    - What conflicted (1–2 sentences).
    - How you resolved it (1–2 sentences).
6. Merge the PR.
